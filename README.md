## üéØ Using Different Models

### Default Setup (Pre-configured)

The runtime comes **pre-configured** with `distilgpt2`, a lightweight and fast model perfect for beginners:

- **Model**: `distilgpt2` (82M parameters, ~250MB)
- **Auto-download**: Downloads automatically on first use
- **Performance**: Fast responses, low memory usage
- **Perfect for**: First-time users, testing, lightweight conversations

### Easy Model Switching (4 Steps)

Want to use a different model? Here's how:

1. **Choose your model approach**:
   - **Automatic download** (recommended): Use model names like `"gpt2"`
   - **Manual download**: Download files and place in `models/` folder

2. **For automatic download** (easiest):
   - Open `config.py` in Notepad
   - Change `MODEL_NAME = "distilgpt2"` to `MODEL_NAME = "gpt2"`
   - Save and run the assistant

3. **For manual download**:
   - Create a `models` folder in `mini_gpt_assistant` directory
   - Download model files and place them in `models/your_model_name/`
   - Update `config.py`: `MODEL_NAME = "models/your_model_name"`

4. **Run the assistant**:
   ```
   Double-click run_assistant.bat
   ```

### Recommended Models

#### Ready to Use (Auto-download)
```python
# Edit config.py - these will auto-download on first use
MODEL_NAME = "distilgpt2"              # Default - Lightweight, fast (250MB)
MODEL_NAME = "gpt2"                    # Standard GPT-2 (500MB)
MODEL_NAME = "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium"  # Conversation-focused (350MB)
```

#### Popular Model Examples
```python
# Lightweight models (good for limited hardware)
MODEL_NAME = "distilgpt2"              # 82M parameters, ~250MB - DEFAULT
MODEL_NAME = "gpt2"                    # 124M parameters, ~500MB

# Conversation models
MODEL_NAME = "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium"  # 117M parameters, optimized for chat
MODEL_NAME = "microsoft/DialoGPT-large"   # 345M parameters, better responses

# More capable models (require more resources)
MODEL_NAME = "gpt2-medium"             # 345M parameters, ~1.5GB
MODEL_NAME = "facebook/opt-350m"       # Facebook's OPT model
```

### Model Setup Process

**Quick Setup with Bat Files:**

1. **Test your setup** with `python demo.py` (optional)
2. **Check GPU** (optional) with `python check_gpu.py`
3. **Edit config.py** if you want a different model - open with Notepad and change `MODEL_NAME = "distilgpt2"` to your chosen model
4. **Double-click run_assistant.bat** to start

**Example for beginners (already done by default):**
- The runtime is pre-configured with `distilgpt2`

   python check_gpu.py   # If you have GPU issues
   ```

2. **Check the specific error** in `run_assistant.bat` output

3. **Review detailed logs** in `logs/assistant.log`

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Model Download Issues
**Problem**: First-time download fails or is slow

**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Wait for download to complete (distilgpt2 is ~250MB)
- Try again - Hugging Face servers can be busy
- Model files are cached in `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface`

#### Memory/GPU Errors
**Problem**: Not enough VRAM or system RAM

**Solutions**:
- Default distilgpt2 should work on most systems
- Disable GPU: Set `USE_GPU = False` in config.py
- Close other applications
- Run `python check_gpu.py` to diagnose GPU issues

#### Import/Dependency Errors
**Problem**: Missing packages or environment issues

**Solutions**:
- Rerun setup: `setup.bat`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version: `python --version` (needs 3.11+)
- Run `python demo.py` to identify specific missing packages

#### GPU Not Detected
**Problem**: GPU available but not being used

**Solutions**:
- Run `python check_gpu.py` for detailed GPU diagnosis
- Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch: 
  ```bash
  pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
  ```
- Update NVIDIA drivers
- Set `USE_GPU = False` in config.py to use CPU
